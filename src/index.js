import React from 'react';
import Routes from './routes';
import './config/statusbarConfig'

const App = () => <Routes />;

export default App;

// The code above is similar to doing: 
/*class App extends Component {
    render () {
        return <Routes />
    }
}*/
// however the last has more functionalities
